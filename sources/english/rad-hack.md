## MOVEMENT & DISTANCE

Rather than track precise numbers, The **Rad-Hack** uses 4 abstract ranges for measuring distances. **Close**, **Nearby**, **Far-Away** and **Distant**. On their turn every character can move somewhere **Nearby** as part of an action, performing that action at any stage of the move. They can forgo their action and move somewhere **Far-Away** instead. Anything beyond **Far-Away** can be classified as **Distant** and would take 3 moves to get to.

If you want to use existing modules, new and old, with more defined movement rates or measures, use the following table as a guide:

|  CLOSE   |   NEARBY   |  FAR AWAY  |
|:--------:|:----------:|:----------:|
| 0 - 5ft  |   5 - 60ft | 60 - 120ft |
| 0 - 1,5m | 1,5 - 20m  | 20 - 40m   |

## ENCUMBRANCE

A character can carry a number of items equal to their STR with no issues. Carrying more than this amount means they are **encumbered** and all attribute tests are taken with **Disadvantage** - you can also only ever move to somewhere Nearby. A character simply cannot carry more than double their STR.

## EXPERIENCE

Adventurers learn through defeating and overcoming obstacles. Killing another Raider won’t bring a revelation of learning to someone. Surviving a bunker expedition, completing a mission or simply living to tell the tale are the things that bring perspective and growth. The old experience system has been completely discarded.

GAINING LEVELS
For every session, bunker level, dangerous mission and/or major event the character survives they gain a level. The GM will decide which, and it’s recommended that this decision remains more or less a constant throughout the campaign - and a **GM** should be clear and upfront with the players so they know where the ‘goalposts’ are. When a character **levels** up, their maximum Hit Points increase by rolling the Hit Die for the class. A player should also roll a d20 for each Stat. If the result is higher - that Stat increases by 1.

## DRUGS & ADDICTION

All drugs take effect immediately after they have been used and last for **d6 blissful minutes**. When the effect wears off, you get Disadvantage to all INT and WIS tests for the **following hour**. If any one drug is used more than once per day, a CON test must be passed or the user becomes **addicted**. An addict must take one hit every 8 hours, or get disadvantage to all **INT**, **WIS** and **CHA** tests. Drugs are normally easy to come by, and the pricing depends entirely on the supply and demand, but normally cost between 20-50 Slugs/dose.

|  NAME      |   EFFECT                                                                           |
|:-----------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Aggro      |  Gain 2 AP and get Advantage to all STR tests.                                     |
| Brainz     | Advantage to all INT/WIS tests and against Psionic Attacks.                        |
| Speed      | Act first and get Advantage to all DEX tests.                                      |
| Sweet      | Advantage to all CHA tests.                                                        |
| Stimpack   | Instantly heals 2d6 damage.                                                        |
| Cleaner    | Induces terrible vomiting while curing all addiction. Pass CON test or lose d6 HP. |
| Rad-Off    | Refreshes Radiation Die by one step, up to its maximum.                            |
| Rad-Screen | Gain Advantage when rolling Radiation Die for 1 hour.                              |

## RADIATION

When you approach a zone that is glowing from radiation, roll your **Radiation Die**.

Depending on how close you are to the source of the glow and the level of radiation, roll more or less often - **Low**, 1/day, **Moderate** 1/hour, **High** 1/minute, **Extreme** 1/moment. Reduce **CON** and **Max HP** by **2** for each step the radiation die has decreased from its original size. If you roll 1-2 on a radiation die the size of a d4, roll a d6 on the table below.

The radiation die never goes below d4, but a roll on 1-2 still counts as if it was reduced. Certain Tech and drugs mitigate the effects of radiation.

| RESULT | EFFECT                                                                 |
|:-------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
|    1   | **Glowing** - 1-in-6 chance to gain a random mutation.                 |
|    2   | **Skin peel** - Disadvantage on all CHA tests for 1 day.               |
|    3   | **Headache** - Disadvantage on all INT tests for 1 day and d6 damage.  |
|    4   | **It stings!** - Take d8 damage.                                       |
|    5   | **It burns!** - Take d12 damage.                                       |
|    6   | **“I’m melting!“** - You melt into a glowing, horrible mess (and die). |

## POISONS

Poisons come in many different forms and can cause a wide variety of effects on the victim. Most poisons will require a passed **CON** test to resist and/or neutralize. See table below for examples of poisons:

| TYPE           | EFFECT                                              |
|:---------------|:----------------------------------------------------|
| Venom          | Victim takes d6 damage every Minute.                |
| Hallucinogenic | Victim hallucinates for 1 hour.                     |
| Sleep          | Victim is knocked out for 8 hours. Can be awakened. |
| Paralyzing     | Lose ability to move.                               |

## CONTROLLING ROBOTS

Humans can attempt to give a nearby robot an order as an action. They must successfully test their **CHA** for each robot they are attempting to control, adding the Robots’s **HD** to the roll. The GM can also give further modifications, Advantage/Disadvantage to the roll depending on the complexity of the order. Robots that are Controlled by Humans must spend all their actions and movement to obey the command of the Human for 2d4

Moments after being Controlled. After that, their software reboots and they go back to their original command. Robots will normally not obey orders to attack another human being.

| ORDER                       | MODIFICATION |
|:----------------------------|:------------:|
| “Give information about...” |       -      |
| “Protect...”                |      +1      |
| “Unlock/Lock...”            |      +2      |
| “Attack...”                 |      +3      |
| “Shut down...”              |      +4      |

## RANDOM ENCOUNTERS

The GM should roll a d4 every 15 minutes of real world play, or whenever it makes sense in the fiction (when the player characters are being loud). A result of 1-2 means the players will encounter a randomly generated creature or distraction in the following Minutes (turn).

## CREATURE REACTIONS

Some creatures and NPCs will have predetermined personalities and goals that will guide a GM when choosing their actions and feelings towards the characters. Those that do not, such as randomly encountered creatures, make a d8 Reaction roll on the following table:

| RESULT | REACTION                     |
|:-------|:-----------------------------|
|   1    | Flee then roll again.        |
|   2    | Avoid the PCs entirely.      |
|   3    | Trade with PCs.              |
|   4    | Give the PCs aid.            |
|   5    | Mistake the PCs for friends. |
|   6    | Trick the PCs (roll again).  |
|   7    | Call for Reinforcements.     |
|   8    | Capture/Kill/Eat the PCs.    |

## TECH

Tech is a collective term for highly advanced, pre-apocalypse equipment that give its owner a variety of beneficial effects and abilities. **Tech Weapons** might add +2 to any attribute being tested while using it, ignore armor, sets enemies on fire, etc. **Tech Armor** can double the amount of AP the armor type would normally have, protect its user from radiation, refresh spent AP after every combat, or other beneficial effects. Most (if not all) Tech rely on a steady supply of **Energy Packs**, a rare and expensive power supply. An Energy Pack has a d6 Usage Die, but more powerful variations are rumored to exist.

Without these, most tech items simply will not work. When creating your own Tech, try to make the items unique from each other. They are supposed to be powerful, one-of-a-kind equipment that give its owner an edge.

When rolling to see the **Quality** of Tech, roll a d6 instead of the normal d8.

## UNDERSTANDING TECH

To effectively use Tech, you must first understand how it works. Normally it is enough that the player describes how her character experiments with the Tech, but some highly advanced Tech requires a successful INT test to fully understand and make use of. Such a roll is often made with Disadvantage.

| EXAMPLE      | NAME                  | EFFECT                                                                                                                  |

| Item          | Quantum Communicator | Sender and Receiver. Can send short messages one way. Unlimited range. Everyone Nearby rolls their Radiation Die.       |

## VEHICLES & DRIVING

Everyone can drive a **Vehicle**, but it takes skill and a successful **DEX** check to pull off a crazy or daring maneuver behind the wheel. Vehicles have Hit Points and Armor Points.

These can only be repaired if **Scrap** is used and an INT test is passed. Attack rolls made while in a moving vehicle have Disadvantage, while Defense Rolls have Advantage. When a vehicle reaches 0 Hit Points, roll a d6 on the table on the opposite page.
